# Work diary

One file per working day, `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Days with no work get no file — gaps are information,
not something to backfill.

| Section | What goes in it |
|---|---|
| **Tasks due today** | Written *first thing*. With a tracker, the issue table; without one, the plan of attack as bullets. Never edited later to match what happened — the gap between this and the work log is the useful part. |
| **Work log** | Chronological, written as you go. What was done and why, with commit refs and links. Prose beats a checklist: this is the part you actually reread months later. |
| **Plans & commits** | Generated. The day's commits grouped under the plan each belongs to, plus untagged work under **Unplanned**. Each group carries what its agent turns cost. |
| **Ad hoc todos** | Things that surfaced today and are in no tracker or plan. One `###` heading plus a collapsed `<details>` block each, so a future session can pick one up cold. |
| **Notes** | Decisions, lessons, blockers, carry-forward. Anything that changes the project's direction belongs in `CLAUDE.md` or the architecture docs as well — the diary is the trail, not the source of truth. |

## Running it

```sh
./scripts/work-diary.py              # today's entry, plus a filename hygiene check
./scripts/work-diary.py 2026-09-14   # a specific day
./scripts/work-diary.py --hygiene --apply   # fix misnamed plan files and their links
./scripts/work-diary.py --no-cost    # skip the token-cost lines
```

It creates the file from `_template.md` if missing, then regenerates **Plans & commits**. Safe to
re-run at the end of the day — it only touches text between the `<!-- generated -->` markers, so
everything written by hand is left alone.

## How plans, tasks and commits link up

1. **Plan → tasks** — the `## Tasks` checklist inside the plan file.
2. **Plan → commits** — a `Plan:` trailer on the commit naming the plan's slug.
3. **Day → plans** — this diary, generated from those trailers.

A plan also appears in the entry for the day it was *started*, before it has any commits, so the
trail begins at the moment of deciding rather than at the first commit. A trailer naming a plan
file that does not exist is flagged rather than silently dropped.

Work that does not deserve a plan lands under **Unplanned**. That is a normal outcome, not a
failure to plan — a diary where nothing is ever unplanned is a diary someone is gaming.

## What the cost lines mean

Every group carries a line like `**Cost:** 402k tokens · ~$14.80`, broken down per model, with a
day total underneath once there is more than one group. It is read from Claude Code's own session
transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/`, matched to this repo by its path.

- **Dollars are exact per session.** They come from the `cost-state` record Claude Code writes
  itself, not from a price table this repo would have to keep up to date.
- **The split between plans is an estimate.** A turn is charged to the first commit that lands at
  or after it, on the reasoning that work precedes the commit carrying it. Long gaps, interleaved
  work and amended history all blur that. Read the per-plan figures as proportions, not invoices;
  only the total is exact.
- **Turns after the day's last commit fall to Unplanned**, because nothing has claimed them yet.
  They move under a plan as soon as the commit that finishes that work exists and you re-run.
- **A running session shows `~$12.34+`** — Claude Code records the dollars when the session ends.
  Token counts are right immediately; re-run the next day for the final figure.
- **Token counts are slightly lower than what you were billed for.** They only count turns still
  present in the transcript, and a compacted session drops some. The dollars are unaffected.
- **Nothing but counts and dollars is read**, no prompt or file content, and nothing is ever
  written back to `~/.claude/`. Still worth knowing that committing these entries publishes
  roughly what the project costs to run.

With no transcripts — a fresh clone, a different harness, `--no-cost` — the lines are simply
omitted and the rest of the section is unchanged.

## Amending after generating

`work-diary.py` writes commit hashes into the entry. **Do not `git commit --amend` after running
it** — amending changes the hash, and the diary is left naming a commit that no longer exists.

Commit the diary as its own commit instead. That commit will not appear in its own table, which is
a one-commit lag rather than an error; the next run picks it up. A lagging table is fine; a table
pointing at a dead hash is not.

Note that `git cat-file -e <hash>` will still succeed for such a commit, because the object lingers
unreachable until garbage collection. To check reachability properly:

```sh
git merge-base --is-ancestor <hash> HEAD
```

## Ad hoc todo format

```markdown
### 1. Short title describing the todo

<details>
<summary>One-sentence summary of the issue</summary>

- **Current state:** ...
- **What's needed:** ...
- **Relevant files:** ...

</details>
```

When one is fixed, strike the title through and note the resolution in the work log
(`### ~~1. Short title~~ FIXED`). If one turns out to be substantial — multi-day, needs design, or
blocks other work — promote it to a plan or a tracker issue and link it here.
